## Project Description
***
For this project, Deloitte was contracted by the fictitious company Computing Vision to help them launch their new movie studio. Our business task was to research recent trends in movie performance and to develop recommendations for the head of the studio on what kinds of movies to make.

Our team examined a variety of factors pertaining to recent movie releases (2010-present). Of particular interest were the effects of the budget, genre, director, and release date on gross profit and profit ratio.

### Data Interpretation and Analysis
***
Our team performed analyses of movie budget (high: >$2.12mil, low:<$2.12mil), genre, historic director performance, and release season on profits. After importing and cleaning the data, we engineered several convenience features, including profit ratio. These were used to generate visualizations and perform statistical tests on the factors of interest. These informed our business recommendations for the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio.

### Findings and Recommendations
***
Our investigation of the available data has revealed several significant factors to consider in Computing Vision's creation of new movies. First, lower budget movies have significantly higher profit ratios. Second, the trio of mystery, horror, and thriller genres have significantly greater mean profit ratios than other genres. Next, prior director reviews and performance predict movie profit and profit ratio. And finally, summer releases result in higher gross profits than other seasonal releases.

From our analysis, we suggest that Computing Vision...
- Produce low budget films to maximize the return on investment.  
- Make mystery, horror, and thriller films, as they are all budget friendly and produce massive profit ratios. 
- Choose a director with a history of well-rated movies to maximize profit and profit ratio.  
- Release new movies during the summer as that season tends to yield higher gross profits than other seasons.
