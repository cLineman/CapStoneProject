# CapstoneProject
Capstone project for the AI academy 

Team Name: DJ Dirty Pandas

## Project Description

For this project, Deloitte was contracted by the fictitious company Computing Vision to help them launch their new movie studio. Our business task was to research recent trends in movie performance and to develop recommendation for the head of the studio on what kinds of movies to make.

Our team examined a variety of metrics from recent movies (2010-present). Of particular interest were the effects of the budget, genre, director, and release date.
